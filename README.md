# A study on sampling in big data visualization

ilp.py is for solving binary/integer linear programming. The solutions of BLP on small datasets are kept as "ilp_30.npy", "ilp_40.npy", and "ilp_50.npy" for visualization later on.

plots.ipynb is for visualizing results of algorithms on datasets of size 50 and 2000.

The main entrance/ examples of using these functions/algorithms are in plots.ipynb, 1M.ipynb, and ilp.py
